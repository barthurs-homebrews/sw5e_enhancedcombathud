To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the&nbsp;web&nbsp;spell and ready&nbsp;magic missile, your&nbsp;web&nbsp;spell ends, and if you take damage before you release&nbsp;magic missile&nbsp;with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>",

A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p><p>The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:<ul><li>Hold your breath</li><li>March or labor for hours without rest</li><li>Go without sleep</li><li>Survive without food or water</li><li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li></ul></p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong><br/>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p><p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier.
